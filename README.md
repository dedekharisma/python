*   **Python Fundamentals**: Core syntax, data types, and control structures.
*   **Problem-Solving**: Breaking down problems and implementing solutions in Python.
*   **Version Control**: Using Git and GitHub to manage my code and track progress.
*   **Object-Oriented Programming**: The basics of classes and objects in Python.
